#[Team] Guardian Angel Studios Inc – Online SLG Game Looking for Talent

Project Genre & Platform 
Online SLG game on Android and IOS.

The Idea 
There will be 6 Chapter in this game, and there will be 5 critical event and a Finial Battle. Think about the image: millions player playing same game, trying to fight the final boss, BOOM the boss is defeated and then there is the ending scene years of battle for the darkness if finally over, they have won the war. And trailer for the next game. Have you see any multiplayer game have an ending? I don’t remember I have. They are endless, until no one plays it any more. How boring? Have you seen any game let player write the story? I don’t remember I have, that’s why we are crating it.

Progress 
We did start on the demo, not finished yet. This is very early stage. None of the team member is getting paid, we are looking for investors. If not we may go for the Crowdfunding. Any way when the project get fund everyone is getting paid. When the Project get fund, I hope everyone on the team can turn in to full time. I hope this will be a long cooperation, because I already have idea for the next 2 games.

Why this game? 
I believe Game should do so much more than entertainment.

I believe Game can help us to reach our potential.

Be cause I have some habit I want change, like work out every day, but I can only do so long, it never become a habit. that’s why I want build a game that targets our Behavior system. help us to build good habit. like ruining 30 minutes a day or reading books for 30 minutes a day.I know it sounds boring right now, but that's not the game, that's what build in to the game.

If you think game can make a difference in the world. if you think game should help us, Help us become better person. Then join us. Together we can change the world.

What we are Looking For
Artist,Programmer/Developer,Composer,Sound Designer,Level Designer,Scriptwriter.
