High Concept Statement:

Global player spend 3 Billion Hours on gaming every week. What if we can use this time to do something good for the player and community. Under this guild line I come up this game Uncharted Space. What the player does is raising this AI called Guardian Angel to fight a rouge Bio-mechanical Intelligence called Zero. But Guardian Angels are weak, they don’t stand a chance if they face Zero now. So player need do all they can to make their GA more powerful, like Reading books for 20minunt every day, like running 20mins every day etc. when the GA gets more powerful they can infiltrate or defend information Hub. And eliminate enemy robot. There will be 6 Chapter in this game, all player have to unite and try defeat Zero, while doing so, Zero will try to transform all humans to Bio-mechanical form. And there will be 5 critical event for each chapter decide who will have an upper hand and will change every thing after that. At the end their will be a final battle between GA and Zero.  Who win the final battle will be determined by how much effort player have put in. So yes, the GA could loss the final battle, and all humans will become Bio-mechanical form. The game is trying to let player build trust and teamwork and working on something that is bigger than themselves.
